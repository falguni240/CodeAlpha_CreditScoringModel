# CodeAlpha_CreditScoringModel

# Project Title
Credit Scoring Model â€“ CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship

# Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict an individual's creditworthiness based on financial features.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset
Used a credit default dataset with features like income, balance, student status, etc.

# Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
3. Logistic Regression model training
4. Evaluation using:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall
   - F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Score

# Results
Achieved effective performance in classifying defaults with clear ROC curve visualization.
